Python File Handling for Data

Data is often stored in files. Python can read, write, and handle these files easily.

1) CSV Files
- CSV = Comma Separated Values, like a spreadsheet.
- You can write data to CSV or read data from it.

Example - Writing CSV:
import csv
with open("data.csv", "w", newline="") as file:
    writer = csv.writer(file)
    writer.writerow(["Name", "Age", "City"])
    writer.writerow(["Ali", 23, "Multan"])

Example - Reading CSV:
with open("data.csv", "r") as file:
    reader = csv.reader(file)
    for row in reader:
        print(row)

2) TXT Files
- TXT files are simple text files.
- You can write text to a file and read it back.

Example - Writing TXT:
with open("notes.txt", "w") as file:
    file.write("Python is fun!\n")
    file.write("File handling is easy.\n")

Example - Reading TXT:
with open("notes.txt", "r") as file:
    content = file.read()
    print(content)

3) JSON Basics
- JSON = JavaScript Object Notation, a popular format for structured data.
- Python can convert dictionaries to JSON and back.

Example - Writing JSON:
import json
student = {"name": "Ali", "age": 23, "city": "Multan"}
with open("student.json", "w") as file:
    json.dump(student, file)

Example - Reading JSON:
with open("student.json", "r") as file:
    data = json.load(file)
    print(data)

4) Working with Large Files
- Large files can crash your program if read all at once.
- Read them **line by line** to save memory.

Example:
with open("notes.txt", "r") as file:
    for line in file:
        print("Line:", line.strip())
