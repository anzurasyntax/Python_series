Python Data Structures

1) Lists
- Think of a list as a row of boxes where you can keep things.
- You can change, add, or remove things from a list.
- Lists can have duplicate items.

Example:
fruits = ["apple", "banana", "cherry", "banana", "date"]

Filtering - take only what you want:
bananas = [fruit for fruit in fruits if fruit == "banana"]
# Result: ['banana', 'banana']

Slicing - take a part of the list:
first_three = fruits[0:3]  # ['apple', 'banana', 'cherry']

Add/Remove items:
fruits.append("elderberry")  # add at the end
fruits.remove("banana")       # remove first 'banana'

---

2) Tuples
- A tuple is like a list, but you cannot change it after making it.
- Good for keeping things that should stay the same.

Example:
person = ("Ali", 23, "Multan")
print(person[0])  # "Ali"

❌ Cannot do: person[1] = 24  # Error

---

3) Sets
- A set is a collection of items, but:
  1. No duplicates
  2. No order (items are mixed)
- Good for removing duplicates or checking if something exists.

Example:
numbers = [1, 2, 3, 2, 4, 1, 5]
unique_numbers = set(numbers)
print(unique_numbers)  # {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}

Add/Remove items:
unique_numbers.add(6)
unique_numbers.discard(2)  # remove 2

---

4) Dictionaries
- A dictionary is like a box with labels (key) and things inside (value).
- Good for storing data with names.

Example:
student = {"name": "Ali", "age": 23, "city": "Multan"}
print(student["name"])  # "Ali"

Add/Update items:
student["grade"] = "A"  # add new info
student["age"] = 24      # update info

Loop through dictionary:
for key, value in student.items():
    print(key, value)

# Output:
# name Ali
# age 24
# city Multan
# grade A
