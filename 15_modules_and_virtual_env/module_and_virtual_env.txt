Python Modules and Virtual Environments

1) import
- Modules are like ready-made Python tools.
- Built-in modules come with Python.
- Example:
import math
print(math.sqrt(16))  # 4.0
print(math.pi)        # 3.14159

- You can also import specific functions:
from math import ceil, floor
print(ceil(3.2))  # 4
print(floor(3.8)) # 3

---

2) pip
- pip is a tool to install Python libraries from the internet.
- Example: install 'requests' library
Terminal command:
pip install requests

- Using requests library in Python:
import requests
response = requests.get("https://api.github.com")
print(response.status_code)  # 200 means success

3) Virtual Environments (venv)
- A virtual environment is like a separate Python workspace.
- Helps keep libraries for each project separate.
- Commands (run in terminal):
python -m venv myenv          # create a new environment
source myenv/bin/activate      # activate (Linux/Mac)
myenv\Scripts\activate         # activate (Windows)
pip install <package>          # install libraries inside environment
deactivate                     # exit environment

- Using virtual environments prevents conflicts between projects.
