Conditional Statements
    Conditional statements are used to make decisions in a program.
    They allow the program to execute certain code only if a specific condition is True.

    1) if Statement
            Checks a condition.
            If the condition is True, the code inside the if block runs.
            If it’s False, the code is skipped.
        Syntax:
            if condition:
                # code to execute if condition is True

    2) elif Statement
        Stands for “else if”.
        Used to check additional conditions if the previous if or elif was False.
        Syntax:
        if condition1:
            # code if condition1 is True
        elif condition2:
            # code if condition2 is True


    3) else Statement
        Runs a block of code if all previous conditions (if and elif) are False.
        Syntax:
        if condition1:
            # code if condition1 is True
        elif condition2:
            # code if condition2 is True
        else:
            # code if all above conditions are False

!important Notes
        1) condition is an expression that evaluates to True or False
        2) Indentation (usually 4 spaces) is mandatory in Python
        3) You can use if alone without elif or else
