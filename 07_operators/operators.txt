Operators
    Operators are symbols that perform operations on values or variables.

    1) Arithmetic Operators
        Used to perform mathematical calculations.
            + → Addition
            - → Subtraction
            * → Multiplication
            / → Division
            // → Integer division (Return Integer value after round off)
            % → Remainder (modulus)
            ** → Power / Exponent

    2) Comparison Operators
        Used to compare values. The result is always True or False.
            == → Equal to
            != → Not equal to
            > → Greater than
            < → Less than
            >= → Greater than or equal to
            <= → Less than or equal to

    3) Logical Operators
        Used to combine multiple conditions.
            and → True if both conditions are True
            or → True if any condition is True
            not → Inverts the Boolean value (True becomes False, False becomes True)
