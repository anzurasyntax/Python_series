Loops
    Loops are used to repeat a block of code multiple times without writing it again and again.
    They are very useful when you need to perform repetitive tasks.

    1) for loop
        Used when you know how many times you want to repeat something or when you want to iterate over a sequence.
        Syntax:
            for item in sequence:
                # code to execute

    2) while Loop
        Used when you want to repeat something until a condition becomes false.
        Syntax:
            while condition:
                statement(s)


Special Statements in Loops
    break → Stops the loop immediately, even if the condition is still True.
    continue → Skips the current iteration and moves to the next one.
    pass → Placeholder; does nothing, but allows the code to run.
