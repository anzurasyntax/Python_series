variable   
    A variable is a container that stores data in memory.
    In the python we assign any value in any variable that use again and again in our program

Variable Naming Rules
    Some rules is defined to give name for any variable 
    1) Must start with a letter or underscore _
    2) Can contain letters, numbers, underscore
    3) Case-sensitive (age ≠ Age)
    4) Should be meaningful
    5) not use keyword as your variable name (keyword are special words that Python already understands.)
        Common Python Keywords:
            if, else, elif
            for, while
            break, continue
            def, return
            class
            try, except
            True, False
            None

Some Wrong Variable Names
    1age = 20      # cannot start with number
    my-age = 30    # hyphen not allowed
    class = 10     # keyword not allowed

Some Correct Variable name
    age = 20
    user_name = "Hello"
    totalMarks = 85
